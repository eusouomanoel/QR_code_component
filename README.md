## Overview
HTML:
I have created an HTML structure that contains only a body.
In the body section, you have embedded a QR code image, which is generated by a QR code generator tool or library.
You have also added descriptive text and a label for the QR code.
CSS:
You have used CSS to style the HTML elements.
You have applied some basic styling like setting the font-size, font-family, padding, margin, etc.
You have also added some specific styles for the QR code section, such as setting the width, height, and aligning the text.

## My process
- First I did the background color. After created the flex-container to help me a centralize the card. With that in mind, I align the itens and image with padding and margin.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Centralize one only div for the page.

### Continued development

Work more with flex, grid, margin and padding measures.
